# CECS 378 Lab Assignment: Analytical Ethics Essay

## Assignment Description

In this assignment, you will write an analytical essay examining the ethical dimensions of modern surveillance technology using Shannon Vallor's *An Introduction to Cybersecurity Ethics* as your foundational framework. Your analysis will focus on the ethical issues raised in the New York Times article titled *"How Geo Group’s Surveillance Tech Is Aiding Trump’s Immigration Agenda."*

This is not a summary paper. You must analyze the actions, technologies, and implications described in the article using the ethical categories, frameworks, and challenges outlined by Vallor. Your essay must treat Vallor’s work as the **primary reference point** for your ethical reasoning—not just a citation, but the lens through which your entire analysis is constructed.

Additionally, your essay must include an **explicit ethical stance**: if you were offered the role of **lead engineer on the surveillance product described**, would you accept it? Why or why not? Justify your answer using Vallor’s framework and values (e.g., respect for human dignity, justice, transparency, public good, and human flourishing).

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:
- Apply Vallor’s five-part ethical framework to real-world cybersecurity practices
- Identify the impact of surveillance technology on privacy, justice, and human rights
- Take a clear ethical stance and justify it with philosophical and practical reasoning
- Develop professional writing competency grounded in ethical awareness

## Required References

Your essay **must** include:
- **Primary reference**: Shannon Vallor's *An Introduction to Cybersecurity Ethics*  
  → Your paper must actively use Vallor’s ethical values and decision-making frameworks throughout.  
  → Cite and explain her concepts clearly when analyzing the New York Times article.

- **Case study**: The New York Times article *"How Geo Group’s Surveillance Tech Is Aiding Trump’s Immigration Agenda"*

- **At least one additional academic-quality source** related to cybersecurity ethics, surveillance, or technology in public policy.

Use **IEEE citation style** for all references. [Citation Guide](https://ieee-dataport.org/sites/default/files/analysis/27/IEEE%20Citation%20Guidelines.pdf)

## Required Essay Content

- Clear application of Vallor’s ethical concepts to the case study
- Discussion of ethical concerns (privacy, justice, accountability, etc.)
- Your **personal ethical stance**: Would you accept or reject a leadership role on this technology? Why?
- Meaningful engagement with all required sources

## Format and Submission

- Length: 750–1500 words (~3–6 stylized pages)
- Output Format (**mandatory**): Submit in one of the following file formats:
  - **PDF**
  - **Markdown**
  - **RTF**
  - **HTML**

> **No other formats will be accepted.**  
> You must **submit your completed essay through the class-generated Git repository** provided. Commit your final version with a clear message (e.g., `Final ethics essay submission`).

## Evaluation Criteria

Your essay will be evaluated on:
- Depth and clarity of ethical analysis
- Correct and thoughtful application of Vallor’s framework
- Engagement with the New York Times case
- Clearly stated and well-justified ethical stance
- Integration of an additional academic-quality source
- Technical quality of writing (organization, grammar, structure)
- Correct use of IEEE citations and required file format

## Final Note

This assignment is meant to sharpen your ability to evaluate not just *what* technology does, but *whether* it should be done—and under what conditions. If engineers don’t ask those questions, who will?

Ethics isn’t optional in cybersecurity. It’s mission-critical.
