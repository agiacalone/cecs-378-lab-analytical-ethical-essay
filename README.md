# CECS 327 Lab Assignment: Analytical Essay 

## Assignment Description
Your assignment is to write an analytical essay about a topic relating to this course: *Networks and Distributed Computing*. Your essay must have at least 3 unique academic-quality references and use the proper citation methods for **IEEE stylizing**, [which can be found here](https://ieee-dataport.org/sites/default/files/analysis/27/IEEE%20Citation%20Guidelines.pdf). The minimum length requirement is 3 stylized pages (about 750 words), with an upper-bound of around 6 pages or roughly 1500 words.

The depth of the analytical essay should reflect the complexity of an upper-division university term paper, which is to say that it should emphasize the analytical aspect of the writing much more than the summary aspect of writing (i.e. depth > breadth). 

Sample topics include (but are not limited to) the following:

* [Clock Synchronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_synchronization)
* [Internet Security and the Use of Firewalls](https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-emerging-threats-what-is-firewall.html)
* [Advancements in Distributed Computing Introduced with the Plan 9 Operating System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs)
* [Distributed Computing Usage in High-Traffic MMO Games](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289719929_Scalable_software_architecture_for_distributed_MMORPG_traffic_generation_based_on_integration_of_UrBBaN-Gen_and_IMUNES)

* [Real-Time Operating System Usage in Distributed Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_operating_system)
* [Load Balancing Performance on LAN Networks](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/load-balancing/)

## Deliverables
Yes, we're using git to write research papers now! Maybe you find it annoying...but I find it awesome. :D

Submit your research paper through this git repository. Use one of the following formats:
* Plain Text (go old-school!)
* Markdown (it's like plain text--but better!)
* HTML (no one ever does this one...but it's neat, too, and you should think about it.)
* RTF (if you *must* use something like Word)
